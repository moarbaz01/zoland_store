            Eligibility for Refund
          </h2>
          <p>
            To be eligible for a refund, we require a receipt or proof of
            purchase.

            Refund Process
          </h2>
          <p>
            Once your refund request is received and inspected, we will send you
            an email to notify you that we have received your request for a
            refund. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your
            refund.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit
            will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method
            of payment, within a certain number of days.
          </p>

            Late or Missing Refunds
          </h2>
          <p>
            If you haven&apos;t received a refund yet, first check your bank
            account again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, contact your bank, as there is often some processing time
            before a refund is posted.
          </p>
          <p>

            refund yet, please contact us at zolandstore23@gmail.com.
